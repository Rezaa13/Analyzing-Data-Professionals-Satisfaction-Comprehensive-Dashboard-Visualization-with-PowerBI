## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the analysts understand the condition of data professionals. It helps us to know if the data professionals are satisfied with their professional lives. Through different ratings, they get to know their life and work balance. It also lets them know the average salary, gender, areas, positions, and percentage of their satisfaction by using this dashboard. The interactive dashboard shows different real-life statistics.
The database contains 630 rows with 30 attributes. So, we can get almost any information from 630 real-life data professionals. 



### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Load data into Power BI Desktop, and transform the data according to my output requirements.

- Step 2: I had to pre-process some of the columns. I transformed some common things into one column, deleted some unnecessary data, and some number modifications for our calculation.

- Step 3: It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.

- Step 4: I Created a model view and relationships between columns.
- Step 5: In the report view, I tried to summarize the situation of data professionals nowadays by providing real-life information.

- Step 6: Since the data contains various ratings, interactive charts were presented in the visualizations pane in the report view to represent ratings. 

- Step 7: A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the number of satisfied & neutral/unsatisfied professionals. While creating this visual, a field named "Gender" was also added to the Legends bucket, the number of professionals is also segregated according to gender.
